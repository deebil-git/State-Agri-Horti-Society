								<p>The beginnings of the State  Agri-Horticultural Development Cooperative Society Ltd., can be traced back to  the year 2005, when a group of agri-horticultural experts came together to  bring awareness, training, education, products and services to uplift the lives  of the rural communities in the South Kerala. Over the years, their efforts  grew to become a Society, registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, and  comprising a membership of over 2000 marginal, small and medium scale farmers  and related stakeholders in the region. It is the only cooperative society of  its kind to receive the accreditation of the Dept of Finance, Government of  Kerala today.</p>

									<h3><span> Why State Agri Horti Society?</span></h3>
								</div>
<p>Indias planned approach to self-sufficiency in agriculture and improved rural economy gained pace with the green revolution of the 70s. During the decades that followed, several developmental initiatives made in the agro-industrial and economic infrastructure built the co-operative agri-horticulture sector to become one of the countrys largest spread of national resources, even by global dimensions. It is against this dynamic growth background that the Society earned its trust and goodwill to become a 2000-member farmers organization that continues to improve the lives of South Keralas rural population.

  initiatives that improve livelihood standards of target group.</p>

<p>“I am happy to see that our Society is moving into a new phase of growth and capacity expansion. Nearly two decades have
gone by, and despite our track-record of implementing a number of agri-horticultural and rural development projects, the challenge before us is to reach for higher goals and larger engagements. I am confident the enterprising spirit and commitment that drive our team will bring home such achievements in the near future.”</p>

<p>“The measure of success of any enterprise does not end with its growth in the balance sheet or market share. The real impact is when an institution becomes a catalyst for bringing positive changes in the lives of the people. Living in peace and harmony with one another and the environment and eco-system is the essence of human development. Our Society’s future
thrust shall be to sharpen our capabilities, expand the rural development response and to focus on the aptitude and attitude of a new generation for greater responsibility and accountability.”</p>  
                               
   <h3>150 Years of Celeberating The Mahathma</h3>                                
 <img src="img/about.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""></br>
                  <p>Mahatma Gandhi was a great patron of the cooperative movement. He believed that cooperative farming could reduce labor, capital, agricultural inputs and provide employment to all adult villagers whilst increasing production. “In regard to agriculture, we must do our utmost to prevent further fragmentation of land; and (must) encourage people to take to cooperative farming … we shall have to produce more of what we can, in order thereby, to obtain in exchange what we are unable to produce.”, he said. </p>
                    <p>On this 150th Birth Anniversary of the Mahatma, we re-affirm our commitment to strengthen cooperative farming and build on the concept of good agricultural practices (GAP).</p>
